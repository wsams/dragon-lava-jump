# Dragon Lava Jump

A side-scrolling platformer in which you guide a dragon across platforms, over lava, past enemies, and to the golden door. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Phaser 3**.

## About the game

- **Goal:** Reach the golden door at the end of the level before running out of lives. Collect dots, avoid or defeat slimes, bats, and crawlers, and use lava bounces and power-ups to get ahead.
- **Movement:** Run left/right, jump (including double jump in mid-air), and use an air boost to dash forward. Fire breath can defeat slimes and crawlers when you have the fire totem.
- **Hazards:** Lava (instant death unless you have a lava bounce), slimes, bats, crawlers, and stalactites. Checkpoints and extra lives help you progress.
- **Levels:** Play random generated levels or saved levels. Difficulty affects platform layout, enemies, and items (e.g. lava bounce, fire totem).

## How to run

Open `dragonlavajump.html` in a browser, or serve the project folder with any static file server (e.g. `npx serve .` or `python -m http.server`) and open the page. Audio may require a user gesture (e.g. click or tap) before playing in some browsers.

## Controls

- **Space:** Jump (double jump allowed once per air time)  
- **F:** Air boost (forward dash in the air, once per jump)
