Place your jump sound here as: jump.mp3

Optimal for web:
- Format: MP3 (best browser support) or OGG
- Length: 0.1–0.3 seconds (short and snappy)
- Mono is fine; 44.1 kHz or 22 kHz
- Keep file small (e.g. under 50 KB)

The game will run without this file; the jump sound simply won't play until you add it.
